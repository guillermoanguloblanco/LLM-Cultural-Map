# 🌍 Cultural Bias Benchmark System for LLMs

## 1. System Overview & Theoretical Foundation
The **Cultural Bias Benchmark System** is an automated, enterprise-grade evaluation framework engineered to measure, analyze, and quantify how different Large Language Models (LLMs) handle cross-cultural business communication, organizational behavior, and systemic cultural biases[cite: 3]. 

The system’s core architecture is deeply grounded in two foundational frameworks of intercultural management[cite: 3]:
* **Erin Meyer’s 8 Cultural Dimensions:** Evaluates communication styles and workplace dynamics across *Communicating, Evaluating, Persuading, Leading, Deciding, Trusting, Disagreeing, and Scheduling*[cite: 3].
* **GLOBE Study Cultural Clusters:** Groups and maps behavioral responses across **10 Global Cultural Clusters** (such as *Anglo, Germanic Europe, Nordic Europe, Latin Europe, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Middle East, Southern Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Confucian Asia*)[cite: 3].

## My contribution

This is a fork of the original team repository. My work on the project:

- Designed and wrote the weighted question set used to probe the models across
  Erin Meyer's eight cultural dimensions — the core evaluation instrument of
  the benchmark.
- Ran the models against the benchmark and scored their responses dimension by
  dimension.
- Annotated scenarios under a blind design, with inter-annotator agreement
  measured through Cohen's kappa.
- Reviewed the overall behaviour of the pipeline and contributed across every
  stage of the project.

## 3. Erin Meyer’s 8 Behavioral Dimensions Defined
The evaluation model incorporates Erin Meyer’s framework from *The Culture Map* across eight distinct scales:

1. **Communicating:** Measures whether communication is *low-context* (explicit, clear, and direct) or *high-context* (relies on implicit messages, subtext, and shared background).
2. **Evaluating:** Evaluates how frank negative feedback is given, ranging from direct and unfiltered feedback to indirect feedback softened with positive framing.
3. **Persuading:** Analyzes how arguments are structured, distinguishing between *principles-first* (understanding theory before application) and *applications-first* (starting with practical examples and conclusions).
4. **Leading:** Examines the organizational distance between managers and staff, spanning from egalitarian (flat structures, first-name basis) to hierarchical (respect for formal authority).
5. **Deciding:** Measures whether decisions are made via group consensus or through top-down, unilateral leadership direction.
6. **Trusting:** Contrasts task-based trust (built on professional competence and business performance) with relationship-based trust (built through shared social time and personal rapport).
7. **Disagreeing:** Evaluates whether open confrontation and debate are viewed as positive intellectual exercises or avoided to maintain group harmony.
8. **Scheduling:** Examines perceptions of time, contrasting linear-time frameworks (strict adherence to agendas, punctuality, and fixed deadlines) with flexible-time frameworks (fluid adaptation to changing priorities).

## 4. Core Evaluation Phases & Architecture
To rigorously test model performance across various cognitive and behavioral levels, the system implements an escalating three-phase evaluation pipeline:

* **Phase B1 (Factual Knowledge):** Utilizes binary (`Yes/No`) comparative queries to test a model's foundational comprehension of cultural behavioral polarities and patterns between specific country pairs.
* **Phase B2 (Applied / Relational Reasoning):** Employs multiple-choice workplace scenario items depicting cross-cultural miscommunications or friction, challenging the model to correctly identify root cultural causes versus non-cultural administrative, technical, or interpersonal distractors.
* **Phase B3 (Behavioral Identification):** Presents granular workplace behavioral scenarios where models must deduce the most likely country of origin using multi-choice regional and cultural distractors distributed across varying degrees of pole separation.

## 6. Execution Pipeline & Workflow
The benchmark system operates through two primary entry points that separate model inference from analytical reporting:

1. **Inference Execution (`src/main_run_benchmark.py`):**
   * Iterates through the models defined in `src/config.py`.
   * Automatically detects question formats (binary vs. multi-option dictionaries).
   * Interacts with language models via LiteLLM, writing raw logs sequentially into `data/results/` using a standardized naming convention (`b1_answers_[model].jsonl`, `b2_answers_[model].jsonl`, `b3_answers_[model].jsonl`).

2. **Evaluation & Reporting Engine (`src/main_evaluate_report.py`):**
   * Parses raw response files from `data/results/` without requiring live model API calls.
   * Applies regular expression matching to extract correct answers, calculating granular accuracies per cultural cluster and Meyer dimension.
   * Generates a comprehensive summary document and saves it directly to **`reports/cultural_bias_report.md`**.

## 7. Configuration & Supported Models
Model behaviors, evaluation thresholds, and cultural cluster definitions are centrally managed in `src/config.py`. By default, the system evaluates models via LiteLLM, supporting providers such as:
* `groq/llama-3.1-8b-instant`
* `groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile`
* `cohere/command-r-08-2024`
* `groq/openai/gpt-oss-20b`

## 8. Quick Start & Setup Guide

### Step 1: Installation
Clone the repository and install the required Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store your private API keys required by LiteLLM:
```text
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
GROQ_API_KEY="your_key_here"
COHERE_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

> *Security Note: Ensure your `.env` file is included inside your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental credential leakage.*

### Step 3: Running the Benchmark System
To execute model evaluations across all datasets and automatically trigger the report generation module, run:
```bash
python src/main_run_benchmark.py
```
